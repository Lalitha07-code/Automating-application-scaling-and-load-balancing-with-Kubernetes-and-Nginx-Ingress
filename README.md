# 🚀 Automating Application Scaling and Load Balancing with Kubernetes & Nginx Ingress

This project demonstrates how to automate the scaling of containerized applications and manage traffic routing using *Kubernetes* and the *Nginx Ingress Controller*. The goal is to build a resilient, auto-scaling infrastructure with efficient load balancing for production-grade deployments.

## 📖 About the Project

In this project, we:
- Containerized an application using Docker.
- Deployed it to a Kubernetes cluster.
- Enabled *Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)* based on CPU usage.
- Configured *Nginx Ingress Controller* for routing and load balancing.
- Integrated *CI/CD pipelines* for automated deployments.
- Set up *monitoring and logging* tools for visibility and performance tracking.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```plaintext
User --> Nginx Ingress --> Kubernetes Service --> Pods
                          ↳ Auto Scales via HPA


                          ↳ Metrics gathered by Prometheus
